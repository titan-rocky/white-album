## Project Description
This is a Web App which focuses on displaying images of servers , specially home servers , to all people . This project aims on providing an accessible UI having the basic utilities of
* View : Gallery, Induvitual, Slideshow
* Upload / Download
* Deletion
of images , controlling remotely from the client without any necessary interaction knowledge between the providers and the client.
When common people find it difficult to configure backup storages by logging into their image servers , as well as conncting them , this app will come handy, making their images visible and giving them easier **accessibility** and control

## Demo

## Connectivity
This web app runs with [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) as the service provider , and the web application server is being hosted in Vercel , a cloud-based platform for development , deployment and scale of projects , enabling multiple users to access with a URL as per the architecture. The app has the capabilities of fetching requests from the cloud provider, and rendering the same to enable view of the contents in the cloud.
This project is a prototype. I'm working on to make it versatile to be hosted on any storage server, using some limited , required data necessary to authenticate the request, and also to avoid unauthorized access.

## Frameworks
I have selected **Next** as the full stack framework in this application , since i felt that a **Powered React Frontend** will be most suitable for rendering , in terms of this application, and also to work on the entire document components , having a full control over it. Using the **Beta** /app version of Next JS 13 , gives me a lot of opportunities to work more with react , since i have been working on react currently.

As of CSS frameworks, this app has been completely developed with **Tailwind CSS** , since it makes life with CSS easier , less code space , and thus faster coding experience.
